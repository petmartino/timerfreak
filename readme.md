# TimerFreak - Your Custom Sequence Timer

TimerFreak is a simple yet powerful web application designed to help you manage timed sequences. 
Whether you're following a workout routine, a cooking recipe, or any activity that requires a series of timed steps, 
TimerFreak ensures you stay on track with visual progress bars and custom alarms for each segment.

Easily create custom sequences with multiple timers, name them, set unique colors, and choose specific alarm sounds. 
You can loop sequences, jump to any timer, and track your progress with a global timeline. 
It's built to be straightforward and effective, helping you focus on the task at hand without distractions.

## Setup and Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-url]
    cd TimerFreak
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Download Alarm Sounds:**
    Navigate to the `static/` directory and download your desired MP3 alarm sounds. You can use `wget` or `curl`. Ensure the filenames match those referenced in the database migration (e.g., `alarm.mp3`, `beep.mp3`, etc.).
    Example:
    ```bash
    cd static/
    # Replace with actual direct download links to CC0 or public domain MP3 files
    # wget -O alarm.mp3 "https://example.com/alarm.mp3"
    # wget -O beep.mp3 "https://example.com/beep.mp3"
    # ... and so on for bell.mp3, chime.mp3, ding.mp3
    cd ..
    ```
    (Note: The default sounds from `app.py` are `alarm.mp3`, `beep.mp3`, `bell.mp3`, `chime.mp3`, `ding.mp3`. You need to ensure these files are present.)

5.  **Initialize and apply database migrations:**
    ```bash
    flask db init
    flask db migrate -m "Initial migration" # Only if this is the first time running migrations
    flask db upgrade
    # After adding the Sound table and initial data migration (see instructions from your collaborator), run:
    flask db migrate -m "Add Sound table and initial data" # This will create a new migration script
    # IMPORTANT: You MUST manually edit the newly created migration file to insert initial sound data.
    # Follow the instructions provided by your collaborator for editing the upgrade/downgrade functions.
    flask db upgrade # Apply the updated migration
    ```
6.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    flask run --host=127.0.0.1 --port=5001
    ```
    Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5001/`
